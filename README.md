## 🎯 Repository Approach

This repository follows the [awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) structure and conventions for organizing instructions, skills, agents, and plugins to enhance GitHub Copilot capabilities.

### Key Concepts

- **Instructions**: Coding standards and best practices that apply to specific file patterns
- **Skills**: Self-contained capabilities that bundle SKILL.md files with related resources
- **Agents**: Custom AI personas for specialized workflows
- **Plugins**: Installable packages that bundle related skills and agents

See [plugins/](plugins/) for more available plugins.

## 📦 What is a collection?

A **collection** is a YAML file (in `collections/`) that groups related instructions, prompts, and chatmodes into a reusable package. Collections are designed to be consumed by **APM (Agent Package Manager)** to provide "primitives" for AI agents.

### Using collections with APM

[APM](https://github.com/danielmeppiel/apm) allows you to easily install and manage these collections in your projects. Instead of manually copying instruction files, you can use APM to:

- Install a curated set of instructions for a specific technology stack
- Keep your AI primitives up-to-date across multiple projects
- Share best practices with your team

![APM Demo](https://github.com/danielmeppiel/apm/raw/main/docs/apm-demo.gif)

## 🧑‍💼 What is a chatmode? 

A **chatmode** is a configuration file (in `.github/chatmodes/`) that defines how Copilot or another AI assistant should behave in a specific context or workflow. For example, the `architect` chatmode makes the AI act as an experienced architect and technical lead, focusing on planning, documentation, and Markdown-only outputs. Chatmodes can set the tone, priorities, and constraints for the AI during a session or project.

A **meta-chatmode** is a special chatmode file (e.g., `meta-chatmode.instructions.md`) that defines how to write, structure, and validate other chatmode files. Meta-chatmodes ensure that all chatmodes follow a consistent format and best practices across the repository. They specify the required file structure, naming conventions, expected behavior, and validation checklist for chatmode files. 


## 📏 What is an instruction?

An **instruction** is a Markdown file (in `.github/instructions/`) that defines coding rules, architectural standards, and best practices for the project. Instructions are always active and must be followed for all code and documentation generated in the repository. They ensure consistency, maintainability, and alignment with the project's technical vision (e.g., DDD, specification pattern, testing, commit conventions).

A **meta-instruction** is a special instruction file (e.g., `meta-instructions.instructions.md`) that defines how to write, structure, and validate other instruction files. Meta-instructions ensure that all instructions follow a consistent format and best practices across the repository.

## 💡 What is a prompt?

A **prompt** is a template or guidance file (in `.github/prompts/`) used to help Copilot or another AI tool generate code or documentation in a specific style or for a particular use case. Prompts are reusable and can steer the AI in a particular direction for a given task, such as enforcing TDD, writing API documentation, or generating test cases.

## 🎯 What is a skill?

A **skill** is a modular, self-contained package (in `.github/skills/`) that extends GitHub Copilot's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Skills act as "onboarding guides" for specific domains or tasks, transforming Copilot into a specialized agent.

### Available Skills

- **clean-architecture-dotnet**: Complete guide for Clean Architecture with DDD and CQRS (no MediatR), including project initialization scripts and ArchUnit validation
- **application-layer-testing**: Testing Application layer handlers with sociable testing strategy (real Domain objects, mocked Infrastructure)
- **skill-creator**: Create and manage GitHub Copilot skills
